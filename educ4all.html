        <p class="txt-contents">Education is one of the most important drivers for ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity, as well as for improving health, gender equality, peace, and stability. <br>
            Guaranteeing the human right to a basic education means little unless schooling leads to learning for all children and youth.<br>
            Growth, development, and poverty reduction depend on the knowledge and skills that young people acquire</p>

        <p class="txt-contents">Far too many students have become targets of bullying and harassment based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. Their pleas to teachers, principals, and university administrators for help — if they are brave enough to make them in the first place — too often go unanswered. They cannot access quality education.They deserve better than that.</p>
